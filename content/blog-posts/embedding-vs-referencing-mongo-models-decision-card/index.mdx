One of the most common decisions when designing MongoDB schemas is whether to
embed related data or reference it. This decision card provides a systematic
approach to making that choice.

## How to Use This Decision Card

For each guideline, answer the question and note whether it favors **Embed** or
**Reference**. Add up the points to get your initial direction:

- **Embed**: +1 point
- **Reference**: +1 point

However, **some guidelines are deal-breakers** that override the point system
entirely. Pay special attention to guidelines marked as potential overrides.

## The Decision Table

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ['Guideline Name', 'Question', 'Embed', 'Reference'],
    rows: [
      [
        <strong>Simplicity</strong>,
        'Would keeping the pieces of information together lead to a simpler data model and code?',
        'Yes',
        'No',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Go Together</strong>,
        'Do the pieces of information have a "has-a," "contains," or similar relationship?',
        'Yes',
        'No',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Query Atomicity</strong>,
        'Does the application query the pieces of information together?',
        'Yes',
        'No',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Update Complexity</strong>,
        'Are the pieces of information updated together?',
        'Yes',
        'No',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Archival</strong>,
        'Should the pieces of information be archived at the same time?',
        'Yes',
        'No',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Cardinality</strong>,
        'Is there a high cardinality (current or growing) in the child side of the relationship?',
        'No',
        'Yes',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Data Duplication</strong>,
        'Would data duplication be too complicated to manage and undesired?',
        'No',
        'Yes',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Document Size</strong>,
        'Would the combined size of the pieces of information take too much memory or transfer bandwidth for the application?',
        'No',
        'Yes',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Document Growth</strong>,
        'Would the embedded piece grow without bound?',
        'No',
        'Yes',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Workload</strong>,
        'Are the pieces of information written at different times in a write-heavy workload?',
        'No',
        'Yes',
      ],
      [
        <strong>Individuality</strong>,
        'For the children side of the relationship, can the pieces exist by themselves without a parent?',
        'No',
        'Yes',
      ],
    ],
  }}
  columnWidths={['25%', '55%', '10%', '10%']}
/>

## Critical Override Scenarios

While the point system provides guidance, certain scenarios should override your
score:

### ðŸš¨ **Document Growth** (Automatic Reference)

If there's any possibility of unbounded array growth, **always reference**.
MongoDB has a 16MB document limit, and unbounded arrays will eventually hit this
ceiling, causing application failures.

**Example**: User comments on a viral post could grow indefinitely.

### ðŸš¨ **High Cardinality** (Strong Reference Signal)

When the child side has high cardinality (thousands+ of related documents),
embedding becomes impractical and expensive.

**Example**: A product with thousands of reviews should reference reviews, not
embed them.

### ðŸš¨ **Document Size** (Performance Override)

If embedded documents would regularly exceed a few MB, the performance cost of
loading large documents often outweighs embedding benefits.

## Quick Decision Framework

1. **Check for deal-breakers first**: Unbounded growth, high cardinality, or
   large document sizes
2. **If no deal-breakers**: Tally your embed vs. reference points
3. **Consider your access patterns**: How often do you need the related data?
4. **When in doubt**: Start with referencing - it's easier to optimize later
   than to fix broken schemas
