At PerformYard, I’ve been helping lead our design system initiative this year,
shaping a system that lets us ship faster - with more consistency, more
confidence, and fewer bugs in prod. It’s not just about reusable components -
it’s about reusable thinking.

How do you scale decision-making across multiple engineers and designers without
turning every button change into a philosophical debate and avoid
[bike shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality)?

One strategy is to give people principles. Not rules. Not commandments carved
into a stone tablet. Just a solid set of “here’s how we think about things”
guidelines that make decisions faster, simpler, and more consistent. Everyone
can be on the same page, and in most cases, the principles can give enough
objectivity to make provable/traceable decisions.

Because here’s the thing: every decision you don’t have to make is one less drop
in the [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue)
bucket, and that stuff can fill up fast.

I'll walk through some of our guiding principles and why they exist—not to not
restrict creativity, but to improve everyone's experience.

## These Are Principles, Not Rules

These principles are here to guide us, not handcuff us.

**But if you need to break one, you better bring receipts** - meaning you should
be able to clearly explain why the exception is justified and why it won’t make
everyone regret life three sprints later.

## Build Like It’s External. Design Like It’s Internal.

Our component library is a bit of a paradox. On one hand, we treat it like an
external library: good docs, intuitive APIs, friendly DX, and no inside
knowledge required to use it. You shouldn’t have to pop open the source code
just to figure out how to make a button green.

But at the same time, we don’t try to make it work for every team, every use
case, or every hypothetical future feature. This isn’t a mega-framework. It’s a
lean, mean, purpose-built toolbox.

###

So unless we need a lever, we don’t add a lever. Otherwise, someone’s going to
pull it—and probably at the worst time.

In short: Be welcoming like it’s public, but minimalist like it’s private.

🎨 Component Color Props: Not a Free-for-All Not every component needs a color
prop. And if it does, we don’t want a rainbow of random CSS variables running
loose.

Use design tokens only. No “#f00”, no “lightish blue.”

Named colors like neutral, green, and blue are the default. Everyone wins when
things are consistent.

Specific shades (e.g., neutral-3) are allowed—but only when needed. Think of
them as sharp knives: use with care.

Hover, disabled, active? Those states should derive automatically from the base
color. The system’s got your back.

📏 Component Size Props: Choose Your Adventure 3 or fewer sizes? Use "small" |
"medium" | "large".

More than 3? Go numeric: 20 | 24 | 28 | 32 and so on.

Sizes should map to our design system’s spacing + typography scales.

Why? Because you shouldn’t need an abacus to figure out which button size
matches your card header font.

😬 The className Prop is Dangerous (Literally) Allowing className on components
opens the door to inconsistent, one-off styling chaos. We’ve been there. It’s
not fun.

Instead, we offer:

tsx Copy Edit dangerouslySetClassName It’s long. It’s scary. It’s supposed to
be. You should only use it when:

There’s no other way.

You’ve exhausted the design system options.

You’ve made peace with your decision and understand the consequences.

Basically: this prop comes with its own seatbelt and airbag.

🧬 Don't Extend All HTML Props Just Because You Can Tempting as it is to do
this:

tsx Copy Edit extends `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>` …don't. That
adds hundreds of props, most of which we never want anyone to touch. It’s the
equivalent of saying, “We trust you completely,” to every dev who uses the
component. (A bold move.)

Instead, we prefer:

tsx Copy Edit extends
`Pick<React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, "onClick" | "disabled" | "children">`
Tighter interface = better autocomplete, better DX, and fewer “wait, why does
this component accept onAbortCapture?” moments.

🧱 Let Parents Handle the Margin Padding is internal. Margin is external. Our
components should not affect layout around them.

If a Card component adds marginRight, it works great—until someone wants to use
it in a column layout. Now you’re stuck fighting invisible space.

Instead, we let the parent decide spacing via layout utilities (like space-x-_
and space-y-_), which keeps components composable and layouts flexible.

Let’s keep surprises in birthday parties, not component spacing.

🛠️ Add Only What You Know You Need A common temptation: “Let’s just add this
prop in case someone might want it someday.”

Don’t. That way lies bloated APIs and painful refactors.

Instead, wait until the need is real and immediate. Then design the feature
intentionally, with clarity and use cases in mind.

It’s easier to add a prop than to deprecate one. Treat additions like tattoos:
no impulse decisions, please.

👯‍♀️ Make the Component API Friendly to Strangers We’ve all had that moment where
we try a component and think, “Cool, but how the heck do I use it?”

The best component APIs are self-documenting. Even better if they’re actually
documented. If you had to hop into Slack or dig through the repo to learn how to
pass a size—that’s a fail.

A new team member should be able to drop into your component library and feel
like it was built just for them. That’s the goal.

🧘‍♂️ Why This Matters: Less Decision Fatigue, More Flow The real reason for all of
this? It’s not just about consistency. It’s about clarity. When the defaults are
clear and the principles are shared, people don’t have to think about every tiny
thing. They just build.

And that’s when the good stuff happens.

excellent article on decision fatigue.

That’s a wrap. If you're working on your own design system, I highly recommend
sitting down with your team and defining some shared principles. It pays off
every time someone makes a fast, confident, correct decision—without Slack,
without meetings, and without breaking anything.

Let your components be boring, so your features can be bold.
