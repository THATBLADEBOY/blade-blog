## What are Cursor Rules?

Cursor Rules are **reusable, scoped instructions** that control AI output in
your development workflow.

Think of them as linter rules for your AI assistant—instead of YAML configs, you
write plain text instructions that tell the AI how to behave, what to do, and
what to avoid.

**The problem they solve:** Large language models are inconsistent without
guidance. Rules provide persistent context that ensures your AI assistant
behaves consistently and inline with your preferences.

## How do Cursor Rules work?

**Simple answer:** Rules are injected as system prompts into the AI model's
context.

When you interact with Cursor (Chat or Cmd-K), your rules automatically become
part of the conversation. Think of them as persistent messages that get added to
every AI interaction.

**Key limitation:** Rules don't apply to Cursor's tab completion feature—only to
explicit AI conversations.

**Technical details:** Cursor is essentially a wrapper around LLM models. At the
end of the day, we're sending text to an LLM and getting responses. Rules
function as messages that get added to the chat context—similar to text you'd
manually input, but stored for reuse.

This approach is confirmed by looking at open source implementations like
[void's convertToLLMMessageService.ts](https://github.com/voideditor/void/blob/2b9e2088b3f480aa7d3f40c1863f7f0cb525efdf/src/vs/workbench/contrib/void/browser/convertToLLMMessageService.ts#L546).

## Rule Application Methods

Rules can be applied in different ways:

- **Automatically** - Always included or triggered by file patterns
- **On-demand** - AI decides when relevant or manually referenced with
  `@ruleName`
- **Manually** - Explicitly added by the user

## Types of Rules

There are 2 types of rules - user rules and project rules.

### User Rules

**Global rules** that apply to ALL your Cursor projects. Set once in your IDE
settings, always active.

    type='video/webm'
  />

#### Key Characteristics

- Plain text only (no advanced features like referencing)
- Personal to you (not shared with team)
- Applied at IDE level, not project level

#### Common Use Cases

- Always respond in a specific language
- Consistent response tone/style
- Universal coding preferences

**Reality check:** Most developers don't use these because few preferences truly
apply to ALL projects ALL the time.

### Project Rules

**Project-specific rules** stored in `.cursor/rules` directory. These can be
version-controlled and shared with your team.

  alt='Project rules'
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
/>

#### Key Benefits

- Encode domain-specific knowledge
- Standardize architecture decisions
- Automate project workflows

#### Nested Rules

Create `.cursor/rules` directories at lower levels (e.g., `/api/.cursor/rules`)
for directory-specific rules that **only apply when files in that directory are
referenced**.

```
project/
  .cursor/rules/        # Project-wide rules
  backend/
    server/
      .cursor/rules/    # Backend-specific rules
  frontend/
    .cursor/rules/      # Frontend-specific rules
```

## How to Create Rules

User rules can only be created through the IDE settings.

Project rules can be created by:

- Creating a new rule file in a `.cursor/rules` directory manually
- Using the built-in command for creating a rule in Cursor (Cmd + Shift + P ->
  Create Rule)
- Asking the agent to create a rule for you
- Using your own cursor rule for creating rules (meta rule)

## Rule Application Methods

Rules are written in MDC format (`.mdc`) with metadata that controls how they
are applied.

- **Always** - Always included in context
  - Useful for rules that should always be included in context. Example: project
    structure rules, rules explaining the project.
- **Auto Attached** - Triggered by file patterns (globs)
  - Useful for rules that should only be included when a specific file is
    referenced. Example: rules react component files can be narrowed down by
    using a glob pattern like `**/*.tsx`
- **Agent Requested** - AI decides when to include (needs description)
  - Useful for rules that should only be included when the agent thinks it's
    relevant to the current task. Example: formatting a blog post, automatically
    calling tools
  - The description is used to determine if the rule should be included in the
    context, so make it clear and concise for the agent to understand when it's
    relevant.
- **Manual** - Only when explicitly referenced with `@ruleName`
  - Useful for rules that should only be included when the user explicitly
    references them. Example: rules for a specific task like creating a new rule

#### Example Rule Metadata

```mdc
{/* Metadata */}
---
description: React component decision tree
globs: ["**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: false
agentRequested: false
---

{/* You'd begin writing the rule here */}

```

## Real-World Examples

Here are some practical cursor rules in action from this very project:

### 1. Simple Component Guidelines

This is a straightforward "always apply" rule for React components:

<RuleSnippet
  title="React Component Guidelines"
  path="components/.cursor/rules/react-components.mdc"
  description="Short, specific, actionable instructions that directly influence code generation."
  snippet="# You are a principal React dev working on a NextJS 15 application.

- Avoid default exports
- Follow best practices for React
- Strive to avoid useEffect unless absolutely neccessary" fullContent="# You are
  a principal React dev working on a NextJS 15 application.

- Avoid default exports
- Follow best practices for React
- Strive to avoid useEffect unless absolutely neccessary
- Declare your components with the 'function' word. Prefer this over arrow
  functions.
- Export everything that needs exported directly from the declaration like:
  export function Example()" type="mdc" />

### 2. Comprehensive Decision Tree

A more sophisticated rule that guides architectural decisions:

<RuleSnippet
  title="React Component Selection Decision Tree"
  path="content/prompts/react-component-decision-tree.md"
  description="Provides a systematic approach that eliminates guesswork and ensures consistency across the codebase."

# React Component Selection Decision Tree

When a new React component is needed, follow this **exact decision tree**:

## Step 1: Check Feature-Scoped Components

- **Location**: \`app/(internal)/[feature]/components/\`
- **Action**: Search for existing component in current feature directory"

# React Component Selection Decision Tree

When a new React component is needed, follow this **exact decision tree**:

## Step 1: Check Feature-Scoped Components

- **Location**: \`app/(internal)/[feature]/components/\`
- **Action**: Search for existing component in current feature directory
- **If found**: Use the existing component
- **If not found**: → Go to Step 2

## Step 2: Check Shared Components

- **Location**: \`/components/\` (root shared directory)
- **Action**: Search for existing component in shared components
- **If found**: Import and use the shared component
- **If not found**: → Go to Step 3

## Step 3: Check shadcn/ui Availability

- **Action**: Use Context7 to search for shadcn/ui components
- **If shadcn component exists**: → Go to Step 4
- **If no shadcn component**: → Go to Step 5

## Step 4: Install shadcn Component

- **Command**: \`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]\`
- **After installation**: Import from \`/components/ui/[component-name]\`

## Step 5: Create Custom Component

- **For feature-specific**: Create in \`app/(internal)/[feature]/components/\`
- **For reusable**: Create in \`/components/\`

## Quick Reference Examples

### Button Component Needed:

1. ✅ Check \`/components/ui/button.tsx\` (likely exists from shadcn)
2. ❌ If missing: \`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button\`

### Data Table Component Needed:

1. ❌ Check feature components
2. ❌ Check \`/components/\`
3. ✅ shadcn has data-table: \`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add data-table\`

### Custom Feature Component:

1. ❌ Not in feature components
2. ❌ Not in shared components
3. ❌ No shadcn equivalent
4. ✅ Create in \`app/(internal)/[feature]/components/custom-component.tsx\`" />

### 3. Meta Rule for Creating Rules

This rule helps create better rules - a self-improving system:

# Cursor Rule Creation Guidelines

Focus on creating rules that directly influence code generation. Rules should
only include instructions that can be automatically applied by Cursor's AI.

## Rule Types

- **Always**: Rules that should always be included in context" fullContent="---
  title: 'Cursor Rule Creation Guidelines' description: 'Meta guidelines for
  creating effective Cursor rules that directly influence code generation and

# Cursor Rule Creation Guidelines

Focus on creating rules that directly influence code generation. Rules should
only include instructions that can be automatically applied by Cursor's AI.
Avoid including general best practices or guidelines that require human judgment
or manual implementation.

## 1. Structure and Format

- Use MDC format with YAML frontmatter
- Required frontmatter fields: \`\`\`yaml
  ***
  description: Clear description of rule purpose globs: [file patterns this rule
  applies to] alwaysApply: true/false
  ***
  \`\`\`
- Keep rules under 500 lines for optimal performance
- Use clear, actionable language

## 2. Rule Types

- **Always**: Rules that should always be included in context \`\`\`yaml
  alwaysApply: true \`\`\`
- **Auto Attached**: Rules that match specific file patterns \`\`\`yaml globs:
  ['**/*.tsx', '**/use*.ts'] alwaysApply: false \`\`\`
- **Agent Requested**: Rules available to AI for context-aware inclusion
  \`\`\`yaml description: Detailed description for AI decision-making
  alwaysApply: false \`\`\`
- **Manual**: Rules requiring explicit invocation \`\`\`yaml alwaysApply: false
  # No globs needed
  \`\`\`

## 3. Best Practices

- Keep rules focused and scoped to specific concerns
- Split large concepts into multiple composable rules
- Include concrete examples or referenced files using @filename syntax
- Write rules like clear internal documentation
- Avoid vague guidance
- Reuse rules instead of repeating prompts" />

### 4. Project Architecture Guidelines

A comprehensive "always apply" rule for project structure:

  title="Next.js Project Guidelines"
  path="content/prompts/nextjs-project-guidelines.md"
  description="Establishes consistent architecture patterns that get automatically applied to new code."

- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4, ShadCN (Radix UI), Framer Motion
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) via Drizzle ORM" fullContent="--- title:
  'Next.js Project Guidelines' description: 'Comprehensive architectural
  guidelines and coding standards for Next.js 15 projects with TypeScript,
  covering structure, patterns, and best practices.' category: 'Development'
  tags: ['nextjs', 'typescript', 'architecture', 'guidelines',
  'project-structure']

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3 (App Router) + TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4, ShadCN (Radix UI), Framer Motion
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) via Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Custom (bcryptjs) using Better Auth
- **State**: React hooks + context (Zustand for global state)
- **Analytics and Error Logging**: PostHog

## Project Structure & Feature Architecture

\`\`\` /app (auth) -> Auth routes (public) -> Public routes (internal) ->
Internal app features /api -> Route handlers /components -> Shared UI components
/ui -> Base UI (Radix-based) /icons -> Icon components /motion -> Animation
utils /providers -> Context providers /db -> Database setup /migrations ->
Migration files /schemas -> DB schemas /seed -> Seed scripts /hooks -> Custom
React hooks /lib -> App-wide utilities /public -> Static assets \`\`\`

### Feature Module Pattern (app/(internal)/[feature]/)

Each feature directory should follow this structure:

\`\`\` /app/(internal)/[feature]/ layout.tsx -> Shared layout loading.tsx ->
Suspense for loading states page.tsx -> Route entrypoint errors.ts -> Feature
Scoped Error Classes actions.ts -> Server actions (service layer) /components ->
Feature-specific UI components \`\`\`

#### Design Goals:

- **Encapsulation**: Each feature is self-contained
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, server logic, and routes are clearly separated
- **Scalability**: Add new features easily using the same pattern
- **Maintainability**: Easy navigation and clear code ownership" />

These examples show the progression from simple rules to comprehensive
architectural guidelines, demonstrating how cursor rules can scale with your
project's complexity.

## Referencing

Use `@ruleName` or `@filename` to reference other rules or files (READMEs,
configs, etc.).

**Note:** This includes the full content, so use sparingly to avoid context
bloat. An alternative approach is to provide instructions for the agent to grep
and look into specific files conditionally.

## Best Practices for Effective Rules

- **Keep rules under 500 lines** - Split large concepts into composable modules
  (500 lines is a rule of thumb from Cursor's documentation)
- **Clarity and conciseness** - Provide concrete examples while keeping
  instructions focused
- **Start small, iterate** - Begin with essential "always" rules, expand based
  on patterns
- **Target repetition** - If you're repeatedly correcting the same mistakes,
  codify them as rules
- **Use smart application** - Leverage globs, nested rules, and agent-requested
  rules to avoid irrelevant context
- **Reuse over repetition** - Create rules instead of repeating instructions in
  chat

## Challenges with Cursor Rules

- **Context bloat**: Despite growing context windows, the
  ["lost in the middle" effect](https://nickbermingham.com/2025/01/paper-review-lost-in-the-middle-how-language-models-use-long-contexts-november-2023/)
  still causes models to miss information in large contexts. Balance
  comprehensive context with token efficiency.

- **Rule use visibility**: No built-in visibility for when agent-requested rules
  activate. Workaround: Add instructions for agents to prepend specific emojis
  to responses.

- **Rule evaluation**: No easy way to measure rule effectiveness—requires
  continuous testing and iteration.

- **Generic public rules**: Public rules offer quick wins but lack
  project-specific tailoring. Custom rules with intent always outperform generic
  ones.

- **Team conflicts**: Shared rules affect everyone. Changes require
  coordination.

- **Stale rules**: Rules become outdated as code evolves. Solution: Create
  maintenance rules that periodically validate and update existing rules.

- **Reliability limits**: Rules significantly improve consistency but can't
  guarantee 100% reliability—they're subject to the same variability as any LLM
  output.

## Conclusion

Cursor Rules transform inconsistent AI interactions into predictable,
project-aware assistance. They're not magic—they're structured prompts that
encode your preferences, patterns, and domain knowledge into reusable
instructions.

**The bottom line:** Rules significantly improve AI consistency and reduce
repetitive corrections, but they require ongoing maintenance and won't eliminate
all LLM variability.

**Start simple:** Create a few "always" rules for your most common corrections,
then expand based on patterns. The investment in setup pays dividends in reduced
friction and better AI outputs.

**Remember:** Custom rules tailored to your specific context will always
outperform generic ones. The goal isn't perfection—it's persistent improvement.
